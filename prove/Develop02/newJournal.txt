The last thing I watched was the 4th episode of Percy Jackson on Disney+. Percy was traveling with Grover and Annabeth to Las Vegas to meet with Hermes. They got a car from Hermes that took them to Santa Monica... but apparently time moved different in the Casino where Hermes was and they arrived too late. But Percy was all like I'm still going to complete my quest!
